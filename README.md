**[WIP note] - the overall project still in development phase. During the development my family had issues caused by covid-19 and that demanded my full attention, the stress about the situation have compromised the ending-half of the project. My main objectives where:**

## General objective
  1. Separate client and administration
  2. Make a simplistic interface to make the system easy for anyone to use
  3. at the code level, make components small enought to be easily exchanged between new versions or new components
## Cashier objective
  1. Make an real-life simulation of items checkout
  2. Minimize cashier operation, let him only type the product references to add into the cart
  3. At the checkout show the client's resume from his shopping cart, including main values, promotions applied and the amount saved
## Administrative Objective
  1. Make separately products, promotions and promotion types registries
  2. Make dynamic promotions to fuffil the most of promotion cases and categories in an realworld market
